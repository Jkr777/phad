  sP6: "In many companies the IT/OT convergence is not a technical problem. The challenge is in overcoming culture and governance issues, which are difficult to get right. With so many stakeholders involved across the business, with different motivations drivers, culture and competing objectives, you first need to identify everyone’s role, and determine who should take accountability and who should take responsibility for securing the critical processes. Getting stakeholders comfortable with being accountable, rather than directly responsible, will take time to work through. To achieve this, you need ‘purple people’ those who are able to build multi-disciplinary teams that have common goals and drivers, and can find a common language between the two worlds. Also getting the different enterprise functions to collaborate is critical. For these two technologies domains to come together effectively, they need to respect and address each other’s concerns. For example, IT security worry they will be heavily impacted by the OT environment, which they perceive to be the “security wild west”, while OT fear the IT security teams will shut down their operations, causing significant financial, reputational, and health and safety consequences. As a result, IT/OT convergence needs to be a business initiative, rather than a separate IT or OT project. This needs to be done holistically and on a case-by case basis..",
